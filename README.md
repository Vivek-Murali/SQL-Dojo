 Navigate through the list of SQL questions in the <b>Q&A</b> listed below. Each question presents a unique challenge, from fundamental queries to more intricate data manipulations.

### Q&A

‚ùì Assume you're given two tables containing data about Facebook Pages and their respective likes (as in "Like a Facebook Page").

Write a query to return the IDs of the Facebook pages that have zero likes. The output should be sorted in ascending order based on the page IDs.

pages Table:
<table>
<tr><td>Column Name</td><td>Type</td></tr>
<tr><td>page_id</td>	<td>integer</td></tr>
<tr><td>page_name</td>	<td>varchar</td></tr>
</table>
pages Example Input:
<table>
<tr><td>page_id	<td>page_name
<tr><td>20001	<td>SQL Solutions
<tr><td>20045	<td>Brain Exercises
<tr><td>20701	<td>Tips for Data Analysts
</table>
page_likes Table:
<table>
<tr><td>Column Name	<td>Type
<tr><td>user_id	<td>integer
<tr><td>page_id	<td>integer
<tr><td>liked_date	<td>datetime
</table>
page_likes Example Input:
<table>
<tr><td>user_id	<td>page_id	<td>liked_date
<tr><td>111	<td>20001	<td>04/08/2022 00:00:00
<tr><td>121	<td>20045	<td>03/12/2022 00:00:00
<tr><td>156	<td>20001	<td>07/25/2022 00:00:00
</table>
Example Output:
<table>
<tr><td>page_id
<tr><td>20701
</table>

``` sql 
SELECT P.page_id FROM pages P LEFT JOIN page_likes PL ON P.page_id=PL.page_id where PL.user_id is NULL ORDER BY P.page_id;
```
Explainations:

To find the Facebook pages that do not possess any likes, we can use the EXCEPT operator. This operator allows us to subtract the rows from one result set that exist in another result set.

Step 1: Retrieve all Facebook page IDs

In this step, we select all the page IDs from the pages table which gives us the initial set of Facebook pages to consider.

Run the following query to obtain an overview of the data:

SELECT page_id
FROM pages;
Step 2: Retrieve Facebook page IDs with likes

Here, we select the page IDs from the page_likes table, representing the set of Facebook pages that have received likes.

Execute the following query to get an overview of the data:

SELECT page_id
FROM page_likes;
Step 3: Find Facebook page IDs without likes

Using the EXCEPT operator, we subtract the page IDs with likes from the initial set of all page IDs. The resulting query will give us the IDs of the Facebook pages that do not possess any likes.

SELECT page_id
FROM pages
EXCEPT
SELECT page_id
FROM page_likes;
Additionally, here are alternative methods to solve the problem:

Method #2: Using LEFT OUTER JOIN

In this method, a LEFT OUTER JOIN is performed between the pages and page_likes tables.

The LEFT OUTER JOIN selects all rows from the left table (pages) and the matching rows from the right table (page_likes).

By checking for NULL values in the likes.page_id column, we can identify the Facebook pages that do not possess any likes.

SELECT pages.page_id
FROM pages
LEFT OUTER JOIN page_likes AS likes
  ON pages.page_id = likes.page_id
WHERE likes.page_id IS NULL;
Method #3: Using NOT IN` clause

SELECT page_id
FROM pages
WHERE page_id NOT IN (
  SELECT page_id
  FROM page_likes
  WHERE page_id IS NOT NULL
);
Method #4: Using NOT EXISTS clause

This method utilizes the NOT EXISTS clause to check for the non-existence of matching records in the page_likes table. It efficiently identifies the Facebook pages without any likes.

SELECT page_id
FROM pages
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT page_id
  FROM page_likes AS likes
  WHERE likes.page_id = pages.page_id
;)
